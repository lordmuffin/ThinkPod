# Product Requirements Document: Claude Integration Web Interface for ThinkPod

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
ThinkPod currently integrates with OpenAI for LLM capabilities but lacks Claude AI access, limiting AI model diversity and creating vendor lock-in risk. The user requires a personal, low-maintenance solution to integrate Claude AI with existing document processing capabilities.

### Proposed Solution
Implement a lightweight Claude AI integration into ThinkPod's existing web interface, providing seamless model switching between OpenAI and Claude with document context preservation. Focus on simplicity, reliability, and minimal operational overhead.

### Success Criteria
- Personal satisfaction with multi-model AI experience
- Stable operation with minimal maintenance requirements
- Successful document context integration with Claude
- Easy deployment and updates through existing ArgoCD pipeline

### Resource Requirements
- Single developer (self-implementation)
- Zero budget (use existing API credits)
- Leverage existing Kubernetes/ArgoCD infrastructure
- Minimal ongoing maintenance effort

## 2. Market Analysis

### Market Opportunity
The AI integration platform market shows explosive growth (29% CAGR) with a $5-10B opportunity by 2027. However, for personal use, the focus shifts to:
- **Vendor Diversification**: Avoiding OpenAI lock-in
- **Model Specialization**: Claude excels at analysis, reasoning, and long-form content
- **Cost Optimization**: Claude's 200K context window reduces chunking complexity
- **Future-Proofing**: Multi-provider architecture enables rapid model adoption

### Competitive Landscape
Personal AI aggregators like Poe ($10-20/month) and ChatHub provide multi-model access but lack:
- Document integration capabilities
- Self-hosted deployment options
- Deep customization for personal workflows
- Integration with existing productivity systems

### User Segments
**Primary User**: Single power user (self) requiring:
- Sophisticated AI model access for research and analysis
- Document-aware conversations
- Low-maintenance, reliable operation
- Integration with existing homelab infrastructure

## 3. User Experience Design

### User Personas and Journeys

**Primary Persona: Technical Researcher/Developer**
- **Goals**: Access best AI model for specific tasks, analyze documents with AI, maintain privacy and control
- **Pain Points**: Vendor lock-in, context loss between platforms, subscription fatigue
- **Usage Patterns**: Daily AI use for research, document analysis, code assistance

```

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Next.js 14 (SSR for better performance)
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for minimal styling overhead
- WebSocket/SSE for real-time streaming

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express (JavaScript ecosystem alignment)
- TypeScript for consistency
- Anthropic SDK for Claude integration
- OpenAI SDK for existing functionality

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL (existing infrastructure)
- Redis for conversation caching
- File system storage for documents

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Kubernetes deployment via ArgoCD
- Rackspace Spot instances (existing setup)

### Integration Points

**Claude API Integration:**
```typescript
interface ClaudeService {
  chat(messages: Message[], context?: DocumentContext): Promise<StreamResponse>;
  validateKey(): Promise<boolean>;
  getModels(): Promise<ClaudeModel[]>;
}
```

**Provider Abstraction:**
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
  type: 'openai' | 'claude';
  chat(params: ChatParams): Promise<Response>;
  stream(params: ChatParams): AsyncIterable<Chunk>;
}
```

### Scalability Considerations
- **Single User Focus**: Optimize for personal use, not horizontal scaling
- **Stateless Design**: Enable easy container restarts and updates
- **Efficient Caching**: Minimize API calls through intelligent caching
- **Resource Limits**: Implement soft limits to prevent runaway costs

## 5. Security & Compliance

### Security Requirements
- **API Key Security**: Environment variable storage, never in code
- **Local Data Control**: All conversations and documents stored locally
- **Minimal External Dependencies**: Reduce attack surface
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches through automated container rebuilds

### Data Privacy
- **No External Logging**: All data remains in personal infrastructure
- **Document Privacy**: Documents processed locally before AI submission
- **Conversation History**: Encrypted storage with user-controlled retention
- **API Isolation**: Separate API keys for different environments

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk Profile**: Single user, personal use
- **API Dependency**: Mitigation through multi-provider architecture
- **Cost Control**: Usage monitoring and automatic limits
- **Maintenance Risk**: Simple architecture reduces complexity
